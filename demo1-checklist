- start doing the presentation for the back-end scripts and graphing packages.
- sorting out the hrefs, filenames and structures of the webpages.
- drop down for nav bars need to be updated with temperature info and jobs needs to be updated with "live jobs" and "job submission"
- get started on the report (i.e. look up UML stuff and starting laying out material)
- test run for demo (hopefully on Thursday but Friday would also work)
